I was trying to write a program that would calculate positions and velocities
of n cars on a road of length L given initial positions and velocities that
were generated by np.random functions. I then fed these values into my defined
STCA/ASEP/CA184 function along with values for L, n, and maximum velocity, vmax.
I used indexing and for loops to adjust the values of the positions and
velocities after each time step. 

From what I can tell, my functions are working correctly. I ran in to trouble
when it came to writing a function that would execute STCA/ASEP N times and 
average the velocities and the positions. I could not figure out how to write
a code that would first execute the function N times THEN average the velocities.
and store everything as an array.

This made it difficult to finish the rest of the project. I feel my biggest
issue was getting everything into proper arrays rather than lists or just
integers. Without the proper arrays it was difficult to get averages and to
make the animation such that cars would flow in an organized manner rather
than bouncing around everywhere.
