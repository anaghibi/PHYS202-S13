Unfortunately I was not able to get my code working correctly in order to 
graph and see the relationship between current, density, and the parameters
of the STCA/ASEP functions.

I believe the random slow downs in the STCA model would cause a decrease in 
the current flow. Also, the density is effected by the number of cars on
the road and the length of the road, which are parameters of the STCA/ASEP
functions. The higher the density the slower the traffic.
